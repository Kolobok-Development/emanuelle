Instructions for setting up project follow setp by step 

Context: I am creating telegram mini app for AI chat companion, multiple subscbscribtion tiers. I need you to set the project for me including authorization through sessions, persmissions for subscribtion done with middleware. As a reference use MinAppExample app that is included in the root folder, but do not use any components from there I have included it just as an example for you. Also, explore my prisma
scheam and modify it if needed. Plese follow theme set up I did inside global css and use telgram ui library that I already installed.

1. Analayze my project structure

3. Anylyze prisma schema and modify it if needed.
4. Set up authentification session storing data in db
5. Create initial page layout
